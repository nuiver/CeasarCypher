# CeasarCypher



Here I am trying to build a Ceasar cipher encoder in Ruby. 

And I am learing how to push my work to GitHub from a local repo.

Apart from that it is also a first training in markdown.

##	Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
